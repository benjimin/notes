Gaza and Australia
==================

I don't know much about the middle east.

The Levant (the eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea and the land bridge from Africa to Eurasia) has been walked by hominins for over a million years.[^homo]

In the 1930s, the Australian Kimberley was investigated by zionists as a resettlement site for Jewish Europeans. An area was procured that included Argyle Downs (now the site of an artificial lake) and was comparable in size to greater Sydney or modern Israel. However, the plan was vetoed by the Curtin government in July 1944 (and the Menzies government again in 1950) due to concerns about social integration.

Australia sacrificed hundreds of soldiers capturing Gaza and Jerusalem from the Ottoman empire. (The Australian cavalry was supported by British infantry, tanks, and gas WMDs.)



[^homo]: One particularly important archaelogical site is on the outskirts of Ubeidiya, a Palestinian town which was depopulated in the Nakba, on an extinct lake in the Jordon Rift Valley near the Sea of Galilee and just south of the Golan heights. Modified stone tools (such as sculpted hand-axes) have been dated to 1.2Ma. See e.g. _Magnetostratigraphic dating of earliest hominin sites in Europe_, Gilbert et al (2024), Earth Science Reviews https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2024.104855
