Gaza and Australia
==================

I don't know much about the middle east.

The Levant (the eastern coast of the Mediterranean sea bridging from Africa to Eurasia) has been walked by hominins for about a million years.[^homo]

...Zionism and the Australian Kimberley

Australia sacrificed hundreds of soldiers capturing Gaza and Jerusalem from the Ottoman empire. (The Australian cavalry was supported by British infantry, tanks, and gas WMDs.)
